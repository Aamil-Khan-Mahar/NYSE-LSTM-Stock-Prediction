Guidelines:\
1. Our Model was trained and predicted on Google Colabs to speed up the process of training the models.\
2. The models were directly saved in the google drive inside the folder \'93Models\'94 - Link for the drive is attached above.\
3. Predicting the Stock Prices took an ample amount of time which is why we\'92ve saved them into a data frame inside our folder  \'93Results\'94 as a csv file \'93predicted_prices.csv\'94.\
4. We also saved our test loss and RMSE\'92s in a csv inside the same folder as \'93loss.csv\'94\
5. We\'92re Submitting the csv files in our zip file as well and we\'92ve modified the notebook to skip the training and prediction cells by setting a boolean variable at the start, if you want to run these cells just set the value to \'93True\'94.\
6. The Notebook we\'92ve submitted is a complete notebook containing the EDA and the Project as well, with both parts separated and clearly labelled. \
